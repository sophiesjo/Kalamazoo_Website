I decided to design my website about Kalamazoo in a way that I thought best represented elements of the community. I chose the main colors of the site to be blue for two reasons. The first being it is a calming color and that could show the laid back atmosphere in Kalamazoo and could be calming for users viewing the site. The second reason is because the Kalamazoo River is very important to the community, so blue for water. 
I chose the navigation bar to follow users along wherever they are in the page and that's because it provides easy access to the other pages anytime they want.
I tried to keep a simple layout so that users aren't distracted by complexities and rather they can find what they're looking for in an efficient manner. 

Challenges that I faced along the way dealt a lot with finding minor mistakes. From this assignment, I've learned to be more careful while first writing my code because it will save me time while validating it, but there were some mistakes that weren't caught by validating the code, so I had to spend more time dissecting the code.
I also found myself wanting to design the text in certain ways, but being stuck on how to make that happen. In these moments, I would usually use Google to research further information, but sometimes found myself more confused by content I would find on the web.
Another challenge I found was getting used to using Codio rather than other coding platforms I have experience with. But after the practicals and this assignment, I feel more confident with how to navigate the site. 

Overall, this assignment taught me a lot and I'm already feeling more confident in my skills as a computer scientist.
