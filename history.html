            <p>Prior to Europeans coming to North America, the Pottawatomi Tribe was the first settlers in the Kalamazoo area.<br>
            They lived along the Kalamazoo River where farming and contrustion of villages were made possible. The river was also used for transportation because of the many connections the river makes between nearby areas.<br>
            There was one village constructed where the river connected to several trails. When Titus Bronson came to Michigan, this village was platted and become known as Kalamazoo.<br>
            Pictured below is the Kalamazoo River and a map showing the many villages along the river.

            <p><br>Following the Revolution, a treaty was made with the Pottawatomi tribe and the US government promising that the tribe could remain in control of their lands. However, the treaty was not honored and the tribes were forced from their lands. European settlers then took control of the Kalamazoo area and the first people of Kalamazoo then became known as the Gun Lake Tribe.<br>
            Because of these unfortunate events, Kalamazoo is now actively trying to honor the Gun Lake Tribe by incorporating their history accurately in education and making aware the tribe's history of the land prior to the start of events in Kalamazoo.</p>

            <h4>Why "The Paper City"?</h4>
        </header>
        <section class="blockedArea">
            <p>Kalamazoo has been known as "The Paper City" because of how successful the paper industry was in Kalamazoo. The business started in 1867 and still continues currently, but the business started to decline in success after roughly one hundred years of business. <br>
            The creation of paper requires lots of water which made Kalamazoo a great spot for the businesses because of the accessibilty to the Kalamazoo River. 
            Following the success of the first paper mill, Kalamazo Paper Company, many entrepreneurs came to the area which led to the creation of many other paper mills. This led to the growth of Kalamazoo and neighboring areas, such as Plainwell, Otsego, and Three Rivers.<br>
            The paper mills' success started to decline in the later 1900s and this is because of many factors, but one major factor is the awareness of how much pollutions the industry was causing.</p>

            <h4>Why "The Celery City"?</h4>
        </header>
        <section class="blockedArea">
            <p>Starting in the 19th century, a wave of Dutch immigrants came into Kalamazoo in hopes of starting celery farms. This was because the soil in Kalamazoo was found to have great conditions for celery production.<br>
                During the ice age, a glacier stopped near Kalamazoo making the soil there rich with clay and loamy muck. These conditions created the perfect environment for celery farming.<br></p>

            <p>Celery began to be shipped out of Kalamazoo at increasing rates because of the unique "white" and "yellow" variety that was grown there.
                The farming industry began to die out as the paper industry took over and caused the water table to become lower, along with a wave of blight harming the crops in the 1930s.</p>

            <h4>Why "The Mall City"?</h4>
        </header>
        <section class="blockedArea">
            <p>In 1959, Kalamazoo became the first city in the United States to create a pedestrian shopping mall outside giving Kalamazoo the name, "The Mall City".<br>
               The mall opened up on South Burdick Street and had quite the celebration for their opening day with 50,000 people attending and the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra playing there.
               The creation of the mall was due to the hope that it would both increase values in nearby real estate and benefit businesses in the area.<br>
               However, the mall ultimatley became a conflict in the city which caused the local government to pave a road once again through the mall in 1998. </p>

            <p>As previously discussed in the "Celery City" section, Kalamazoo became know for the rich soil present there which gave way to an agriculture boom. Following the decline of the celery industry, farmers transitioned to flower beds along with trees and shrubs.<br>
                Agriculture in general started to grow, making Kalamazoo a popular spot for farmers' markets and shipping goods out of the city. Flowers in particle found a great market in Kalamazoo. Still present today, the flower market started growing more in the 1980s and has decreased since then.<br></p>

            <p>It has become increasingly harder in Kalamazo and across Michigan to be a flower farmer because of the decreasing margins of profit, but many farms still continue and ship their production across the US.</p>
